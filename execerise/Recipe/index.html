            <b> 1 </b> a large bowl, add the imitation crab meat, Kewpie mayo, 
            soy sauce, egg white, and cream cheese. Mix until everything is 
            well combined.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b> 3 </b> Sprinkle in the cornstarch and gently fold it into 
            the mixture to help bind the filling together. Set the crab 
            filling aside.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> 4 </b> Spread a generous amount of crab filling on one slice 
            of bread in each pair. Top with a second slice of bread to 
            create a sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> 5 </b>  You can leave the bread as whole slices or cut each 
            slice in half for smaller sandwiches, depending on your preference.

            <b> 7 </b> Press down lightly on the sandwich to ensure 
            the filling adheres well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> 8 </b> Heat vegetable oil in a skillet or deep pan over 
            medium heat, ensuring the oil is deep enough for shallow frying 
            (about 1/4 to 1/2 inch).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> 9 </b>  Once the oil is hot, carefully place the 
            sandwiches in the pan. Fry for 2-3 minutes until the 
            bottom is golden and crispy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> 10 </b> Flip the sandwiches and fry the other side for 
            another 2-3 minutes until it’s golden and crispy.
        </p>

            another 2-3 minutes until it’s golden and crispy.

            such as sweet chili or soy sauce.
